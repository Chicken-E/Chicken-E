Hi!

So you have found my github profile. So let me tell you about myself.

I am a programmer from Finland. I mainly use Node.Js for coding and sometimes java.
I rarely make games and when I do I use Unity and C#. But usually I code small utilities, fun little projects or minecraft plugins instead of games. 

I like to code in the backend, just code. Design ain't my passion.
Just look at my horrendous attempts at html!
Open sourced code is life. I usually make my repos public after I have finished them to a point thats worth sharing.
I'm kinda shy about my code so that often ends up as a reason to keep some as private.
